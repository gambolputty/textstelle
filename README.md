# Textstelle

Textstelle is a collection of corpora for the creation of bots and other things that generate text. It was mainly launched due to a lack of interesting German text collections online by the writers’ collective [0x0a](http://0x0a.li/de/) and [Kathrin Passig](http://kathrin.passig.de/). 


# How to submit new material

You can submit new Material via [this form](https://www.dropbox.com/request/aiA3o71oUgY5HMT9CLyd) or – if you are comfortable with GitHub – create a pull request. A submission consists of:
* A readme file where you give your text collection a title, a short description and state the source of the collection
* files with text (.txt, .csv, json etc)
