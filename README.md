# Textstelle

Textstelle is a collection of corpora for the creation of bots and other things that generate text. It was mainly launched due to a lack of interesting German text collections online by the writersâ€™ collective [0x0a](http://0x0a.li/de/) and [Kathrin Passig](http://kathrin.passig.de/). 

## How to submit new material

You can submit new Material via [this form](https://www.dropbox.com/request/aiA3o71oUgY5HMT9CLyd) or, if you are comfortable with GitHub, you can submit material by creating a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/).
A submission consists of:
1. A readme file where you give your text collection a title, a short description and state the source of the collection
2. One or more files with text (.txt, .csv, json etc)
